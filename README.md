# Progetto di algoritmi e strutture dati -- AA 2020-2021
### Prof. Alessandro Barenghi

The objective of this project was to create a Graph Ranker program in C that was the fastest and used the least ammount of memory possible, without having to make any security, mantainability and concurency considerations.<br>
Complete requirements available [here](https://github.com/CarloChiodaroli/API-2021/blob/master/Graph%20Ranker.pdf) in italian.

This Project was made before attending any class on software engineering, so the code is not pretty at all.

This code was compiled using gcc in ubuntu, and its performance was tested using kcachegrind.

__Final Score:__ 30/30 cum laude

This project gave me the opportunity to deeply study C standard libraries and to think on execution times and memory utilization in order to write the fastest and most efficient program possible.
